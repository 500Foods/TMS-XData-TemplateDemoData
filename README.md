# TMS XData Template: Demo Data
This repository contains a [TMS XData](https://www.tmssoftware.com/site/xdata.asp) project - a REST API server - that serves up a variety of endpoints and sample data.  This may be useful for those first learning to use TMS XData in their own projects.  Or as a template for starting a new TMS XData project, with many core features, like Swagger and a Login endpoint, already in place.

Initially, this example uses SQLite as its database, as well as a collection of include files for all of the SQL operations that have been implemented so far.  Over time, this will be expanded to include support for more databases and more queries.  If there's a database you'd like to see included in the template, by all means please post an Issue or, if you're able, make a Pull Request and we'll see that it gets added.
