# TMS XData Template: Demo Data
This repository contains a [TMS XData](https://www.tmssoftware.com/site/xdata.asp) project - a REST API server - that serves up a variety of endpoints and sample data.  This may be useful for those first learning to use TMS XData in their own projects.  Or as a template for starting a new TMS XData project, with many core features, like Swagger and a Login endpoint, already in place. This project originated as part of a series of blog posts about using TMS XData and [TMS WEB Core](https://www.tmssoftware.com/site/tmswebcore.asp) with different kinds of templates, the first of which can be found [here](https://www.tmssoftware.com/site/blog.asp?post=1068).

## Getting Started
In order to get the most of this repository, you'll need [Delphi](https://www.embarcadero.com/products/delphi) version 10 or later, as well as a current version of [TMS XData](https://www.tmssoftware.com/site/xdata.asp). Note that these are licensed commercial products, but trial versions of both are available on their respective websites.  Please review [The Unlicense](https://github.com/500Foods/TMS-XData-TemplateDemoData/blob/main/LICENSE) that applies to this repository.

The contents of this repository consist of a fully funcitional TMS XData project.  It can be compiled and run as-is without further modification, which will generate a Win64 REST API server application.  Several endpoints, sample data, a SQLite database, and Swagger are already configured. Please refer to the blog post referenced above for more information.

## Contributions
Initially, this example uses SQLite as its database, as well as a collection of include files for all of the SQL operations that have been implemented so far.  Over time, this will be expanded to include support for more databases and more queries.  If there's a database you'd like to see included in the template, by all means please post an Issue or, if you're able, make a Pull Request and we'll see that it gets added.
